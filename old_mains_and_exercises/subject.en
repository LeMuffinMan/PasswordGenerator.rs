Context:
You are an experienced and pedagogical Rust mentor. I have a solid background in C and have already mastered the first 3 chapters of the Rust documentation (ownership, variables, mutability, basic error handling, and reading user input with std::io).

Project Goal:
I want to develop a CLI password generator using the clap crate to consolidate my current knowledge and discover new Rust concepts in a practical way.

What I expect from you:

Series of progressive exercises: Design a sequence of exercises that cover all the concepts needed for my final project, starting from my current level.

For each exercise, provide:

Learning objective: Which specific Rust concept does this exercise teach?

Practical statement: A clear description of what needs to be coded

Reference chapters: Which chapters of the Rust documentation to consult (with precise numbers)

Reflection questions: 3–4 questions to deepen my understanding of the covered concepts

Success criteria: How to know if I have completed the exercise successfully

Suggested structure:

Isolated exercises for each concept (structs, enums, advanced error handling, traits, etc.)

Progressive integration exercises leading toward the final project

Final exercise: assembling the complete password generator

Likely necessary concepts to anticipate:

Structs and methods

Enums and pattern matching

Error handling with Result and Option

Traits and implementations

Collections (Vec, HashMap, etc.)

External crates (clap, rand)

Unit testing

Organizing code into modules

Desired format:
Structure your responses clearly with titles, minimal example code, and concise but complete explanations.


Perfect, with your background in C and your mastery of chapters 1 to 3 of the Rust Book, we can build a progressive series of exercises that will lead you step-by-step to your CLI password generator using `clap`.
Here’s the **progression** I suggest.

---

## **Learning Plan in Exercises**

### **Exercise 1 — Structs and Methods**

**Learning objective**

* Learn how to create a `struct`, instantiate it, and implement methods using `impl`.

**Practical task**
Create a type `PasswordConfig` containing:

* length (`u8`)
* booleans for including lowercase, uppercase, digits, special characters
  Add a `describe()` method that prints the current configuration.

**Reference chapters**

* Chapter 5: Structs and Methods
* Chapter 3.1: Variables and Mutability (as a review)

**Reflection questions**

1. What’s the difference between `&self` and `&mut self` in a method?
2. Why use a `struct` instead of a tuple here?
3. What happens if a `struct` field is left uninitialized?
4. Can a `struct` be made immutable after creation?

**Success criteria**

* `PasswordConfig` is correctly defined with the right fields.
* `describe()` method works and outputs the expected description.
* Code compiles without warnings.

---

### **Exercise 2 — Enums and `match`**

**Learning objective**

* Use `enum` to represent choices and `match` to take actions based on them.

**Practical task**
Create an enum `Strength` with variants `Weak`, `Medium`, `Strong`.
Add a function `strength_label()` that returns a descriptive string for each variant.

**Reference chapters**

* Chapter 6: Enums and Pattern Matching
* Chapter 19: Advanced Patterns (later, for deeper understanding)

**Reflection questions**

1. What’s the difference between exhaustive `match` and `if let`?
2. Why is `match` on an `enum` compile-time safe?
3. How can you add associated data to a variant (payload enums)?
4. What happens if you add a variant to the `enum` but don’t update the `match`?

**Success criteria**

* Enum is well-defined and used correctly.
* `match` is exhaustive, with no unnecessary `_` default arm.
* Function returns correct values for each variant.

---

### **Exercise 3 — Error Handling with `Result` and `Option`**

**Learning objective**

* Work with `Result` and `Option` using `match`, `unwrap`, `expect`, and the `?` operator.

**Practical task**
Write a function `read_length_from_file(path: &str) -> Result<u8, String>`

* The file contains a number (password length).
* If the file is missing or content is invalid, return a descriptive error.

**Reference chapters**

* Chapter 9: Error Handling
* Chapter 6.2: `match` on enums

**Reflection questions**

1. Why is `unwrap` risky?
2. What’s the difference between `expect` and a manual `match`?
3. What exactly does the `?` operator do?
4. When is `Option` preferable over `Result`?

**Success criteria**

* Clear, readable error handling.
* No unjustified `panic!`.
* Function tested with valid, invalid, and missing file cases.

---

### **exercise 4 — collections (`vec`, `hashmap`)**

**learning objective**

* work with `vec` to store and transform the available characters for the password.

**practical task**
create a `vec<char>` containing all possible characters according to `passwordconfig`.
print the contents of the vector.

**reference chapters**

* chapter 8: collections
* chapter 13: iterators (for going further)

**reflection questions**

1. what’s the difference between `push` and `extend`?
2. why choose `vec<char>` instead of `string` for the alphabet?
3. what are the memory implications of a dynamic `vec`?
4. how can you iterate without taking ownership of the elements?

**success criteria**

* `vec` built correctly based on the config.
* no unnecessary code duplication.
* functional iteration.

---

### **Exercise 5 — Using External Crates (`rand`)**

**Learning objective**

* Add and use an external crate to generate random characters.

**Practical task**
From the `Vec<char>` in Exercise 4, generate a random password of a given length.
Use `rand::seq::SliceRandom` or `rand::Rng`.

**Reference chapters**

* Chapter 2: Using external crates (`rand`)
* Chapter 14: Cargo and dependencies

**Reflection questions**

1. What’s the difference between `thread_rng` and `StdRng`?
2. Why is it important to regularly update the `rand` crate?
3. What are the risks of a non-cryptographic random generator?
4. How do you document the dependency in `Cargo.toml`?

**Success criteria**

* Password generated correctly.
* Code uses `rand` crate without warnings.
* Correct length and config respected.

---

### **Exercise 6 — Organizing Code into Modules**

**Learning objective**

* Structure a Rust project into modules (`mod`, `pub`).

**Practical task**
Split your code:

* `config.rs` for the `PasswordConfig`
* `generator.rs` for the generation logic
* `main.rs` for the CLI

**Reference chapters**

* Chapter 7: Modules and Visibility
* Chapter 14: Project organization

**Reflection questions**

1. Why use `pub` on some functions/structs?
2. What’s the difference between `mod` and `use`?
3. How to avoid circular dependencies between modules?
4. What does `super::` mean in a path?

**Success criteria**

* Project organized and compilable.
* Modules separated logically.
* Clear imports.

---

### **Exercise 7 — CLI with `clap`**

**Learning objective**

* Use `clap` to create a command-line argument parser.

**Practical task**
Implement a CLI that accepts:

AI asked me this :
* `--length <n>`
* `--upper` / `--no-upper`
* `--digits` / `--no-digits`
* `--specials` / `--no-specials`

I intentionaly changed the task :
* -l 8 --charset luds : a 8 char long password including all chars
* -l 14 --charset lu : a 14 char long password including only lower and uppercases
* if no lenghth or charset composition are provided, use the config.txt, if no config.txt, use default values

**Reference chapters**

* Chapter 14: Crates and dependencies
* `clap` documentation

**Reflection questions**

1. Why prefer `clap` over manual argument parsing?
2. What are best practices for naming CLI options?
3. How to provide help (`--help`) automatically?
4. What happens if a required argument is omitted?

**Success criteria**

* CLI functional with `clap`.
* Arguments correctly mapped to `PasswordConfig`.
* Clear help messages.

### **Final Exercise — Complete Generator**

**Learning objective**

* Integrate all concepts into a complete, robust, and maintainable project.

**Practical task**
Assemble everything:

* Argument parsing with `clap`
* Creating `PasswordConfig`
* Secure password generation
* Final output

**Reference chapters**

* All previous chapters
* Chapter 11: Unit testing

**Reflection questions**

1. What security improvements would you add (cryptography, entropy)?
2. How would you structure the code to add more generation modes?
3. What automated tests would you write to validate generation?
4. How would you package the tool for distribution?

**Success criteria**

* Code compiles without warnings.
* Complete and ergonomic CLI.
* Valid unit tests.
* Good Rust practices followed.
